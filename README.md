# Proteomic-Repository

## Background and Motivation </h2>

Proteomics carries a growing significance in unraveling biological processes involving proteins — a proteomic study analyzes the protein expression of an organism, tissue, cell, or organelle. Mass spectrometry, a central proteomic tool, allows researchers to categorize proteins using their mass and charge. Proteomics has helped researchers make advancements in the fields of disease research, drug development, and functional analysis. Proteomics plays an essential role in deepening our understanding of diseases and biological functions, which can be applied in fields such as medicine and biotechnology. 

We hoped to create a comprehensive compilation of relevant proteomics information aimed at enhancing accessibility and utilization of proteomics data. 

We sought to bridge the gap between intricate proteomic data sets and the scientific community, by synthesizing relevant information from various research papers in a structured and tabulated format. This approach facilitates efficient comprehension and utilization of data, enabling the broader scientific community to extract valuable information, despite barriers created by fragmented data. 

Our motivation stems from the realization that invaluable proteomics data often exists in a scattered state, creating challenges for researchers to effectively utilize this wealth of information. We meticulously curated essential aspects of the study design, such as blah blah (the categories we will do — maybe metadata and analytical tools?) to empower researchers with a tool that expedites data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. In this way, we aspire to contribute to the acceleration of scientific discoveries and proteomic research advancement.
